# Changelog

## 2026-07-23

- Fixed `GL/glu.h` missing (installed `libglu1-mesa-dev`) — `apps/lobby` and `apps/arena` now build clean.
- Fixed `usleep` implicit-declaration warning at the root cause: `-std=c99` was hiding the POSIX declaration; added `-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE` to `scripts/build.sh`.
- Added connect-ticket accounts (HMAC-SHA256, same scheme as shankpit-460): `packages/common/hmac_sha256.h` ported verbatim, `apps/server` verifies tickets on `PACKET_CONNECT` (fails closed without `REDGARDEN_TICKET_SECRET`), test bots self-mint tickets like shankpit-460's `emily-bot`.
- Added simple matchmaking: new `apps/matchmaker` pairs `PACKET_FIND_MATCH` requests and spawns a dedicated `red_garden_server --port <N>` per match; new `PACKET_FIND_MATCH`/`PACKET_MATCH_FOUND`/`MatchFoundMsg` wire types.
- Validated VS0 (bot-vs-bot match) and VS1 (10 independent headless bots, 5 concurrent matches, matchmaking + accounts, 10s sustained load, zero crashes) via new `scripts/test_10_bots.sh`.
